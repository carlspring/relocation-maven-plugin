Example usage

Relocating a single artifact
----------------------------
    mvn relocate:relocate-single -DrepositoryBaseDir=/path/to/repository  \
                                 -DoriginalGAV=com.foo.bar:zoo:1.1 \
                                 -DrelocationGAV=com.foo.bars:zoo:1.1 \
                                 -DrelocationMessage="The artifact has been relocated from com.foo.bar:zoo:1.1 to com.foo.bars:zoo:1.1."


Notes
-----
Please, bare in mind that once the artifacts have been relocated:
- A backup directory is preserved under the root of the original artifact (/path/to/repository/com/foo/bar/zoo/backup).
- Your artifact repository (Nexus, Artifactory, etc) will need re-indexing for both the original and the relocated directories.
